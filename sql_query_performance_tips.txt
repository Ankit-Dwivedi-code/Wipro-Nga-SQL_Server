* How can performance of a SQL Query be improved?

1. Indexing
2. Avoid selecting * (select only required columns)
3. Always use where clause to filter rows early
4. Use joins appropriately, avoid unnecessary joins
5. Always go with inner joins as compared to left join
6. Create and use indexed views (materialized views)
7. Use EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries (very efficient for large data-sets)
8. Use appropriate data types ex varchar(10) for phone num
9. Enable query caching
10. Query execution plan (SSMS -> CTRL + M)

Performance: Faster response time and throughput
Storage: Efficient use of disk and memory
Scalability : Ability to handle increasing amounts of data or users without performance degradation
Maintainability: Easier to debug, optimize, and extend queries or database design
Cost: Reduced resource usage (CPU, memory, storage) leads to lower operational costs, especially on cloud services
