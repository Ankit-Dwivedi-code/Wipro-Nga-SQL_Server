Difference Between Stored Procedure and Function (SQL)

| Feature          | Function                                         | Procedure                                             |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose          | Used to compute and return a value               | Used to perform a task or series of SQL operations     |
| Return type      | Must return a single scalar or table value       | Can return nothing, a value, or multiple outputs       |
| Calls            | Can be used inside SELECT query                  | Cannot be used inside SELECT queries                   |
| Use in Join      | Can be used in joins                             | Cannot be used in joins                                |
| Transactions     | Cannot manage transactions                       | Can manage transactions (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)      |
| Error handling   | Limited support                                  | Full support                                            |
| Output parameters| Not allowed                                      | Fully supported                                        |
| Invocation       | Called using SELECT dbo.MyFunction(...)          | Called using EXEC or EXECUTE                           |

Additional Differences:

1. **Compilation**:
   - Function is compiled every time it is used.
   - Procedure is compiled only once when created.

2. **DML Operations**:
   - Function cannot perform INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on tables (except for table-valued functions).
   - Procedure can perform all DML operations.

3. **Side Effects**:
   - Function should not cause any side effects like updating data.
   - Procedure is meant to perform actions and can have side effects.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - Function must have a RETURN statement.
   - Procedure can have RETURN, but it's optional and mainly used for status codes.

5. **Execution Plan**:
   - Functions can sometimes cause performance issues inside SELECTs.
   - Procedures are optimized for batch execution.
